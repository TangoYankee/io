    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Tim Miller. I'm a full stack web developer, bioengineer, and former air traffic controller (ATC) for
      The U.S Air Force. TangoYankee comes from the NATO phonetic letters of my ATC operating intials. Every controller
      has a set unique to their facility. Whenever they coordinate with another controller, each controller signs off
      with their initials. It's git blame for aviators!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before serving in the Air Force, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from <a title="Binghamton U"
        href="https://binghamton.edu/" target="_blank">SUNY Binghamton</a>
      with a degree in bioengineering. In the bioengineering program, I used mathematics to model the world as a series
      of complex systems. These systems grow and adapt to
      both instigate and react to change. For example, economies consist of people interacting through the exchange of
      goods and services. Over time, our economy has
      changed from agrarian, through industrial, and now to informational. Along the way, it experienced countless booms
      and busts. A bioengineer's goal is to model,
      predict, and influence that change to acheive a desirable outcome. You can learn more about complexity at the
      <a title="NECSI" href="https://necsi.edu/" target="_blank">New England Complex Systems Institute</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My complex systems perspective led me to become a web developer. The internet is the complex system used to
      influence other complex systems. Computers,
      users, and developers interact to build a network of information. This information is then used in decisions for
      businesses, governments, scientific studies, and countless
      other applications. It's a bioengineer's dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, bioengineering and air traffic control have only gone so far to prep me to be a web developer. Over the
      years, I've honed those
      skills through various team and individual projects. You can see these skills through the resume, projects, and
      GitHub portfolio included below. Thank you
      for visiting!

      This page is a static site with plain html and css. By keeping it simple, it can be mobile friendly, accessible,
      and cross-browser compatible with little effort. Accessibility is checked using the
      <a title="accessibility evaluation" href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank">WAVE</a>
      web accessibility evaluation tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website and all the listed projects are running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. Each project is running on a separate port 
      inside its own docker container. An NGINX server directs traffic to the correct port based on the url path. Access to these ports is
      restricted to only the NGINX server. The server also enforces  https. The security certificates for which are provided by Let's Encrypt 
      and installed with CertBot. The assets for the static site are updated by performing a git pull into the server's master branch from the 
      github repository. The projects are updated by pulling their updated docker builds from docker hub. The docker hub is updated automatically
      when the master branch of each github repository is updated.
